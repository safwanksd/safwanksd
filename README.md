I'm an IT Operations professional with 7+ years of experience, now transitioning my skills into the world of DevOps and Cloud Engineering. I'm passionate about building the automated, reliable systems that great software is built on.

🔭 I’m currently focused on Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and containerization with Docker.

🌱 I love turning the manual operational problems I've solved for years into automated scripts and solutions.
