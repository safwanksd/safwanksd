Hi there, I'm Muhammed Safwan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a former IT Systems Engineer/IT Technical Assistant transforming my 7+ years of hands-on infrastructure experience into a career in DevOps and Cloud Engineering. I am passionate about solving real-world operational problems by building robust, automated systems.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building an automated server health monitoring tool in Bash to automate tasks I used to do manually.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m on a 3-month intensive journey to master AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to system administration, network troubleshooting, or my transition into DevOps!

âš¡ Fun fact: My passion for tech is matched only by my love for organizing film festivals and community events!
